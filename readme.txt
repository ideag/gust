Gust is a port of Ghost admin panel for WordPress.

== Description ==

At the begining, Ghost was supposed to be a fork of WordPress. Then there was a talk of a plugin, that would give a next-generation admin panel for WordPress. But in the process it became a new blogging platform, built on Node.js. This plugin is an attempt to bring the nice and clean admin panel of Ghost back to the WordPress ecosystem. 

Current features:

*   Posts/Pages Markdown editor
*   Media upload integration
*   **NEW** Post tags support

1. Upload `gust` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
